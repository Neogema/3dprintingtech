                        <p class="text-left wow fadeInLeftBig">&emsp;"When Cody Wilson and his company Defense Distributed released 3D printable files for the Liberator gun online back in 2013, an entirely new side of the debate over gun regulation began” (Grunewald). While much of the discussion concerning 3D printing is centered on hobbyists, technological innovations and medical devices, there exists a small segment of society desirous to use the technology for another reason: guns. Blueprints for these weapons are a simple Internet search away and incredibly cheap to purchase. Currently, there’s no screening for who can purchase the blueprints.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4 liberator-column">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;This segment of 3D printing is rife with political and legal significance as the United States and others attempt to navigate these new waters. Are 3D printed guns legal? Are they morally right? What are the consequences to society when blueprints for guns are simply a web search away?</p>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInLeftBig">&emsp;The Undetectable Firearms Act (Hafner) make it illegal to own or carry firearms which are not detectable via metal scanners. This poses a serious security threat in places like concerts, airports, and crowded venues where a person could pass through security undetected. While it’s true that many who wish to print 3D guns may desire to do so simply from a hobby perspective, the danger still exists that those who wish to do so with malintent, certainly could. And should a tragic shooting occur, could the authorities trace the ownership of the gun? For regularly purchased guns, yes. However, 3D printed guns require no serial number like those found on normally sold weaponry.</p>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;If the legal framework weren’t sticky enough, there’s also a moral side to this debate. For instance, were a person to 3D print a weapon and use it in a crime, would the manufacturer of the printer be culpable (Krasny)? Do these manufacturers have a moral obligation to ensure, somehow, that weapons are never crafted on their machines? And if so, why does that same logic not extend to chemical manufacturers whose weapons are used beyond the scope of their intent for bombs and the like?</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-5">
                        <img class="firegif wow fadeInLeftBig" src="resources/images/firearm.gif"> 
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-7">
                        <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;Perhaps another moral concern not often considered is the safety of those who print these weapons. American laws concerning safe manufacturing work under the assumption of centralized manufacturing. A hobbyist in his or her basement does not have the same oversight and yet is now able to create a deadly weapon.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInLeftBig">&emsp;Finally, the most important and debated ethical fear surrounding the 3D printing of guns is the inability to screen who gets a gun. Our current laws require a background check which screens for serious crimes that can bar a person from gun ownership. However, a 3D printer effectively bypasses that screen completely allowing literally anyone to print a gun should he or she choose.</p>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;3D printing is an exciting and new technology with a multitude of possible uses. However, with any new and good evolution of technology, the possibility for danger, maleficence, or crime is also possible. As a nation, we must decide where we stand on this vital issue.</p>

                        <p class="text-left wow fadeInLeftBig">&emsp;In 2011, Ivan Owen made his personal files on 3D printing of prosthetic hands public. Previous to this, traditional prosthetic hands were available at an average cost of $25,000 each. The designs released by Owen allowed for the printing of prosthetics for fraction of the cost. The not-for-profit group e-NABLE can typically produce a prosthetic for $50.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;There are many variables in place to make the prosthetic as accurate and functional as possible. The process typically starts with a scan of the amputated area to determine the proper fit for the new limb. Secondly, the non-injured limb is scanned, if possible, to get a comparison for the construction of the new one. This information is fed into the printer to construct the prosthesis. When construction is complete, leads are setup that attach to the patient’s skin from the artificial limb to identify required movement and respond accordingly. This allows for maximum usefulness of the new limb and increases usability. (all3dp.com)</p>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInLeftBig">&emsp;Hugh Herr, a double foot amputee himself, of MIT has been instrumental in development of these new predictive motion technologies. He has integrated propulsion systems, sensors, and advanced algorithms into the prosthetic to understand, anticipate, and simulate the movement of the wearer to make it a more real-life motion.

                        <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;While the technology to utilize 3D printing is currently available, there are only a handful of, primarily not-for-profit, groups producing them in volume. This is a result of bias for the traditional prosthetics that have been utilized over the years.</p>   
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInLeftBig">The use of 3D printed limbs and prosthetics is much more common in poor, developing countries. This is especially true in Africa where the average annual income is only $315 and there has been near continuous civil unrest resulting in injuries requiring use of prosthetics. (Forbes.com). Moving forward, there is no reason to expect the use of 3D printed prosthetics to diminish. More likely is that they will become more commonplace and therefore accepted in the medical field, resulting in increased usage.</p>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;From an ethical perspective, the most common question surrounding use of advanced 3D printed prosthetics is the competitive advantage given to some people if they are perceived as “half machine”. This has already started in Olympic sports without the use of the advanced predictive motion prosthetics. Oscar Pistorius is a double foot amputee that participated in the Olympics using specialized prosthetic blades. Controversy surrounded him as many wondered whether the blades actually aided him as they increased his stride length. This issue could potentially be compounded if the prosthetics he were to wear in the future were not simple blades, but 3D printed feet with the predictive motion enhancements offered by those at MIT.

                <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;If there was an opportunity to be able to build a home for a few thousand dollars, would you be skeptical or a willing participant? Most people would jump at the chance, without much regard to the consequences or issues that may arise. As the world’s population increases the need for affordable housing has increased. 3D printed construction methods appear to be the perfect solution. 3D printed structures have advanced considerably over the last few years and are just now beginning to enter multiple housing markets worldwide.</p>

                        <p class="text-left wow fadeInLeftBig"> However, there are still some underlying issues that need to be addressed before moving forward with mass producing the 3D printed structures. Issues range from the permitting process, the effects on the construction industry’s job market to the adverse consequences of building shelters for communities with limited resources.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;	One of the biggest issues facing 3D printed homes is being able to become an approved method of construction, in order to pull building permits and pass code enforcement inspections. Most current building codes do not list 3D printed homes as an approved construction method. With the technology being so new, tests are still being conducted on the durability and safety of the structures. As 3D printed structures are still in their infancy stage a lot of different methods are being used to produce structures. Without having a standardized process for building the structures, it is difficult for local agencies to evaluate and approve the changes to the building codes. Until the process or methods become more standardized, it is unlikely to see many changes being made to building codes.</p>
                <div class="row">

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;	The next issue that may arise from 3D printed structures is the reduction of available jobs for skilled workers and laborers. Most 3D printed homes are built utilizing large robotic arms that are controlled by one individual.</p>   
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInLeftBig"> Without the need for additional workers and laborers the job market will be reduced significantly. This will affect the economy as a whole and leave behind an abundance of displaced workers. In addition to the loss of jobs created by traditional building methods using 3D printed structures in poverty stricken areas reduces the local population’s ability to develop new skills and construction methods. By utilizing a 3D printer to build the structures, it effectively removes the ability to re-create new shelters once the printers are removed from the construction sites. Thus, leaving the area in the same state it was in prior to the additional shelters.</p>
                <p class="text-left wow fadeInRightBig">&emsp;	Lastly, an issue that has the potential to arise from using 3D printers as a construction method is gaining the consumer’s acceptance. Using the ideology that inexpensive items are of a lesser quality suggests that the more 3D printed housing becomes available, the less attractive it will become to consumers. However, by adding more competition to the industry prices of a traditionally built home will begin to shift downward, in order for those companies to remain competitive.</p>
